Problem Statement/Objective:-

Implementing basic predix model uisng raspberry pi with Time-series analysis.

Tools Requirement:-

Hardware requirement,
 1.Raspberry pi
 2.temperature/humidity sensor
 3.Gas sensor
 4.memory card
 5.Arduino Uno

Software requirement,
 1.Raspberry pi OS
 2.Python(Library â€“ matplotlib,pandas etc)
 3.GE-Predix platform(Time series analysis)

Dataset:-

The sensor interfaced(like temperature/humidity,gas etc ) to raspberry pi will collect live real time data on seconds or minute or hourly bases in csv file format.

Discription:

The GE predix project is aimed for getting used to Time series analysis of predix platform. In this project, the sensors we have used will provide real time data for analysis. We will used Time Series model and made that work for our project.
